       " <span>I am among the first to buy this phone with prime membership. Posting this review after a week of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good. There is no lagging issue till now. The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first. Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit. Speakers are loud and produce decent sound. Haven't checked the selfie camera and the video recording till now.</span>\n",
